# User Stories

### Development Plan: MoSCoW Prioritization and Agile Methodology
In this project, I implemented an Agile approach combined with MoSCoW prioritization to ensure an organized, user-centered development process. This approach allowed me to focus on delivering essential features first, followed by desirable enhancements, while maintaining flexibility for future improvements.

Using **MoSCoW prioritization** within my GitHub Kanban board, I categorized each user story into four levels:

**Must Have:** Core features necessary for the projectâ€™s functionality, such as product browsing, shopping cart management, and secure checkout.
**Should Have:** Important but non-essential features like search filtering, wishlist functionality, and newsletter subscription.
**Could Have:** Features that enhance the user experience, such as order history and promotional banners.
**Wonâ€™t Have:** Additional features that, while valuable, are not prioritized for the current scope.

This Agile setup with MoSCoW in my Kanban board allowed me to track progress, iterate effectively, and remain adaptable to feedback. By managing development in this way, I focused on delivering a minimum viable product (MVP) quickly, then gradually expanding functionality to enrich the user experience without compromising on quality or project timelines.
